# Image-Correction-Tool

This project presents an interactive image processing application
developed using Python in Google Colab. The system enables users to
upload images and apply a wide range of image filters and
enhancements in real-time. Utilizing libraries such as OpenCV,
NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project incorporates over fifteen different
image transformation techniques including grayscale conversion,
blurring, sharpening, sepia tone, sketch, cartoon effects, edge detection,
brightness and contrast adjustments, geometric transformations, and
more.
A key feature of the application is histogram equalization, which
improves the contrast of images by enhancing the luminance channel
in the YUV color space. Additionally, the project visualizes the
distribution of pixel intensities before and after equalization through
plotted histograms, offering insights into the changes in image contrast.
